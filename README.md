PyPunk2
=======

A python game library (heavily) inspired by the ActionScript3 library FlashPunk by ChevyRay.

Known Issues
------------

* Users with ATI GPUs may notice odd display behaviour occuring. This is an issue with the card itself, and there is absoultely nothing I can do about it. Primarily occurs when non-bitmap graphics are used.

Dependencies
------------

* Python 3 (Tested in py3.3)
* [pySFML](ww.python-sfml.org) 1.3.0
