PyPunk
======

A python game library (heavily) inspired by the ActionScript3 library FlashPunk by ChevyRay.

Dependencies
------------

* Python 3.2
* PySFML2-cython 0.2

Currently there is no build of PySFML2-cython avaliable for Python 3.3, though I would imagine
it is perfectly compatible should you build a copy yourself.
