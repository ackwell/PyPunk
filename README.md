PyPunk2
=======

**NOTE: A (more) official build of Python-SFML is now avaliable. I'll be porting what's finished so far to it, before I add any further features.**

A python game library (heavily) inspired by the ActionScript3 library FlashPunk by ChevyRay.

Known Issues
------------

* Users with ATI GPUs may notice odd display behaviour occuring. This is an issue with the card itself, and there is absoultely nothing I can do about it. Primarily occurs when non-bitmap graphics are used.

Dependencies
------------

* Python 3.2
* [pySFML](ww.python-sfml.org) 1.3.0
