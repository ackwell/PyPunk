PyPunk
======

A python game library (heavily) inspired by the ActionScript3 library FlashPunk by ChevyRay.

Known Issues
------------

* Users with ATI GPUs may notice odd display behaviour occuring. This is an issue with the card itself, and there is absoultely nothing I can do about it. Primarily occurs when non-bitmap graphics are used.

Dependencies
------------

* Python 3.2
* PySFML2-cython 0.2

Currently there is no build of PySFML2-cython avaliable for Python 3.3, though I would imagine
it is perfectly compatible should you build a copy yourself.
